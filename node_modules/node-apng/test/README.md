# Test

The `apngasm.png` images are made using APNG Assembler and the compression
settings are set to zlib + no optimization.

![](apngasm.png)

This is so that it produces the same `truecolor` APNG as the library does.
It can be then compared side-by-side with the library one in two instances of
TweakPNG:

![](tweakpngs.png)

APNG Assembler will place two extra chunks: transparent color before the image
data and a text comment with its credits after the image data.

The image data chunks will have different (smaller) sizes from the ones
generated by the library, or rather the ones passed into the library, as those
those are saved using Paint .NET which seems to be using different compression
(or compression settings) from any of the three compression options found in
APNG Assembler.

APNG Assembler will also use different IDAT/fDAT chunk sizes from whatever the
original frame images are using due to its recompression of them.
